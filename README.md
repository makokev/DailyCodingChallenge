# DailyCodingChallenge
This is my Daily Coding Problem Challenge (C# version).
I will start on 1 Jan 2019 and finish on 31 December 2019.
One problem per day, for 365 days non-stop.

#### Month 1:
The first month is gone. It's hard to find time for coding every day.
I'm trying to be constant but it's not easy. Some days I don't have found enough time to solve the daily problem, but now I've recovered lost problems.

#### Month 2:
Also the second month is gone. I have discovered a lot of new problems or I have reviews old problems but with a different prospective point of view. This challenge is very interesting. 


#### Pending problems (for now : [ ):
23, 55 and 59.

### Source and greatings

The problems are taken from the mailing-list of the official web site: **https://dailycodingproblem.com**.

Enjoy my solutions and write me for any question or suggestion :)
